# ARIMA Model - Website Traffic Prediction

This project focuses on predicting website traffic using an ARIMA model. The goal is to analyze historical website traffic data and build a time series model that accurately forecasts future traffic trends. Below are the detailed steps and methodologies employed in this project:

## Data Collection and Initial Exploration
- Imported necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and suppressed warnings for cleaner output.
- Loaded the dataset `daily-website-visitors.csv` into a pandas DataFrame with the date column parsed as the index.
- Displayed the shape of the dataset and the first few rows to understand its structure and contents.

## Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values by checking for null entries in the DataFrame.
- Converted string representations of numbers (with commas) into integer types for columns such as `Page.Loads`, `Unique.Visits`, `First.Time.Visits`, and `Returning.Visits` to ensure they are suitable for numerical analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated summary statistics to gain insights into the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.
- Created time series plots for each key metric (`Page.Loads`, `Unique.Visits`, `First.Time.Visits`, and `Returning.Visits`) to visualize trends, seasonality, and patterns over time.

## Trend and Seasonality Analysis
- Decomposed the time series data to separate the trend, seasonality, and residual components using seasonal decomposition.
- Visualized the decomposed components to understand the underlying patterns and cyclical behavior in the website traffic data.

## Stationarity Testing
- Conducted stationarity tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) to check if the time series data is stationary, a key requirement for ARIMA modeling.
- Differenced the data if necessary to achieve stationarity, ensuring the mean and variance of the series are constant over time.

## Model Building and Parameter Selection
- Used the ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function) plots to identify potential values for the ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q).
- Iteratively tested different combinations of ARIMA parameters using grid search and evaluated their performance based on criteria like AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).

## Model Training
- Trained the ARIMA model on the training dataset, fitting it to the historical website traffic data.
- Validated the model using a hold-out validation set to assess its predictive performance.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to quantify the prediction accuracy.
- Conducted residual diagnostics to ensure that the residuals of the model are white noise, confirming the model's adequacy.

## Forecasting
- Generated forecasts for future website traffic using the trained ARIMA model.
- Visualized the forecasted values alongside the actual historical data to illustrate the model’s predictive capability.

## Visualization and Reporting
- Created comprehensive visualizations, including time series plots, decomposition plots, ACF and PACF plots, and forecast plots.
- Documented the entire process, findings, and conclusions in the Jupyter Notebook to provide a clear and detailed report of the project.

The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and implementation of the ARIMA model for website traffic prediction, showcasing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.
